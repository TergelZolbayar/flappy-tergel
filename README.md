My Flappy Bird Game 
 I made a Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame,  You gotta help the bird fly through pipes without crashing. It’s like the original Flappy Bird game, but I coded it myself, and something is little bit different from Original flappy bird games. 

What’s This Game About?
It’s a Flappy Bird game where you control a little bird and try to fly through gaps between pipes. Also my flappy bird game have 2 spaces between pipes, it makes easier to get score. Every time you get through a pipe gap, you score a point. But if you hit a pipe or the ground, it’s game over! You can restart and try to beat your high score.

Here’s about my game:

It runs super smooth (60 FPS, which means it’s not laggy).
The bird jumps when you press  R.
You can restart the game by pressing R when you lose.
Stuff You Need
To play my game, you need a couple of things on your computer:

- git clone [<my-game-link>](https://github.com/TergelZolbayar/flappy-tergel.git)
- python --version
- pip install pygame
- type this command "python main.py" on the terminal

How to Play
Start Playing: Just run python main.py, and the bird will jump once to get started.
Make the Bird Jump: Press the the R key to make the bird jump. You gotta time it right to get through the pipe gaps!
Score Points: You get 1 point every time you fly through a gap between the pipes.
Game Over: If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game stops.
Restart: When you see "Game Over," press the R key to play again.
Quit the Game: Just close the window, or if you’re in the terminal, press Ctrl+C.
