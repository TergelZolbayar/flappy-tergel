My Flappy Bird Game 
 I made a Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame,  You gotta help the bird fly through pipes without crashing. It’s like the original Flappy Bird game, but I coded it myself, and something is little bit different from Original flappy bird games. 

What’s This Game About?
It’s a Flappy Bird game where you control a little bird and try to fly through gaps between pipes. Also my flappy bird game have 2 spaces between pipes, it makes easier to get score. Every time you get through a pipe gap, you score a point. But if you hit a pipe or the ground, it’s game over! You can restart and try to beat your high score.

Here’s about my game:

It runs super smooth (60 FPS, which means it’s not laggy).
The bird jumps when you press  R.
You can restart the game by pressing R when you lose.
Stuff You Need
To play my game, you need a couple of things on your computer:

Python: It’s the coding language I used. You need version 3.6 or higher (I used 3.13.3, and it works great). You can get it from python.org.
Pygame: This is a library that helps make games in Python. I used version 2.6.1, but anything above 2.0 should work.
A computer that can show the game window.
How to Set It Up
Here’s how to get my game running on your computer:

Get the Game Files:
If you know how to use Git, you can type this in your terminal:
text

Copy
git clone <my-game-link>
cd flappybird
Or just download the ZIP file and unzip it into a folder called flappybird.
Make Sure Python is Installed:
Check if you have Python by typing this in your terminal or command prompt:
text

Copy
python --version
If you don’t have it, download it from python.org and install it.
Install Pygame:
Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
text

Copy
pip install pygame
To make sure it worked, type:
text

Copy
python -c "import pygame; print(pygame.__version__)"
If it shows a number like 2.6.1, you’re good to go!
Check the Pictures:
My game needs some pictures to work, and they should be in a folder called assets/. Make sure these are there:
bg.png (the background)
base.png (the ground)
bird.png (the bird)
pipe.png (the pipes)
If any of these are missing, the game will stop and tell you there’s an error.
Play the Game:
Go to the flappybird folder in your terminal and type:
text

Copy
python main.py
The game should pop up in a window, and you’re ready to play!
How to Play
Start Playing: Just run python main.py, and the bird will jump once to get started.
Make the Bird Jump: Press the the R key to make the bird jump. You gotta time it right to get through the pipe gaps!
Score Points: You get 1 point every time you fly through a gap between the pipes.
Game Over: If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game stops.
Restart: When you see "Game Over," press the R key to play again.
Quit the Game: Just close the window, or if you’re in the terminal, press Ctrl+C.
What’s in the Folder?
Here’s what’s in my flappybird folder:

Copy

├── assets/          # This has all the pictures for the game
│   ├── bg.png       # The background picture
│   ├── base.png     # The ground picture
│   ├── bird.png     # The bird picture
│   └── pipe.png     # The pipe picture

About the Pictures
My game uses a few pictures, and they’re all in the assets/ folder:

bg.png: The background, stretched to 600x801 pixels to fit the game window.
base.png: The ground, stretched to 600x70 pixels so .
bird.png: The bird, made smaller to 34x24 pixels .
pipe.png: The pipes, stretched to 80x400 pixels.
The pictures need to have see-through backgrounds .

Who Made This?
Me: Tergel. I’m a Year 10 student, and I made this for my computer sciece Python game development project.
Pygame: I used Pygame to make the game. It’s  library for making games in Python. Check it out at pygame.org.
Pictures: I got the pictures from Chrome. 
Idea: This game is based on the original Flappy Bird game by Dong Nguyen. 
How to Use This README
Save the File:
Copy the text above into a new file.
Save it as README.md in your project folder (e.g., C:\Users\zolba\OneDrive\Desktop\flappy\flappybird\README.md).
Fill in the Blanks:
Replace [Your Name] with your name.
Fill in where you got the pictures (e.g., “I found them on Google,” “I got them from a free game assets website,” or “I drew them myself”).
If you have a GitHub link for your project, replace <my-game-link> with the actual link. If not, you can remove that part.
Test It:
If you put this on GitHub, the README.md will show up nicely on your project page.
You can also open it in a text editor like VS Code to see how it looks (VS Code has a preview for Markdown files).
Optional Fun Additions
Add a Picture: If you take a screenshot of your game, you can save it as assets/screenshot.png and add this line at the top of the README:
